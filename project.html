        <h2> Personal Website: "Lybe Data Solutions" </h2>
        <p>This website, which I developed and implemented, aimed to deliver a professional, user-friendly, and accessible website
            representing a data solutions comapny. Link to the website can be found here: <a href="https://lybedatasolutions.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Lybe Data Solutions</a>

        <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
        <p> I did this project alone, therefore I was tasked with doing everything. From creating each pages with contents, also 
            incorporated professional design elements, and responsive layouts. 
        </p>

        <h3>Development Process</h3>
        <p>The process began with drawing a sketch of what the ideal website would look like, choosing a consistent color palette, and
            designing a responsive layout for the website on different screen sizes. I used HTML, appropriate semantic tags, and CSS for
        styling.</p>
        <p>During this process, I struggled with accessibility, and responsive design which led me to do more research on how to align 
            elements consistently across different screen sizes, as well as accessibility which I have been able to successfully implement 
            in my portfolio.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
        <p> A major challenge I faced was ensuring a consistent and uniform naviagtion across pages. Another challenge I faced was creating a visually appealing contact form
            as well as its functionality.
        </p>

        <p> I was able to create a uniform navigation bar in the following assessment, as well as a consistent look in the contact form and its functionality.

        </p>

        <h3>Reflection and Personal Growth</h3>
        <p>
            This project was a valuable learning experience. I have been able to deepen my understanding of web design principles, accessibility, and responsive
            development techniques. Through trial and error, I have been able to troubleshoot issues and optimize layouts.
        </p>

        <p>
            Completing the Lybe Data Solutions website gave me a sense of accomplishment and more confidence in my skills as a web developer.
