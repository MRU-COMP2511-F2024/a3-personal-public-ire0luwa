Hello and welcome. My name is Lola, and I am a passionate software developer specializing in web development. I've had the privilege of working with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and backend technologies. I focused on building user-friendly, efficient, accessible, and responsive websites that meet the needs of both users and businesses. I started my journey in web development with a strong foundation in computer science and over the years, I've developed a law for problems solving and continuous learning. In this portfolio, you find a collection of project I've worked on as well as an overview of how each project looks like. Did demonstrate my skills in web design, coding and user experience. Each project Ilight my process, starting from understanding clients requirements, to delivering fully functional websites. Along the way, I faced major challenges. I've learned new technologies and I've also refined my techniques to become a more efficient and versatile developer. I'm always excited about the next challenge and the opportunity to collaborate with others to create impactful digital solutions. Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio and I look forward to the possibility of working together.
